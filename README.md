## Setup / Installation

No build step is required. The project is a static site.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd StudentPortfolio
   ```

2. **Open in a browser**

   *Option A — Live Server (recommended):*
   Open the project folder in VS Code and launch with the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension. This avoids CORS issues when loading `careers.json` via `fetch`.

   *Option B — Direct file open:*
   Open `index.html` directly in your browser. The app includes an inline data fallback (`data/careers-data.js`) so it works on the `file://` protocol without a server.

3. **Default admin account**
   Register a new account and set the role to `admin` during registration to access the admin panel at `admin.html`.

## API Documentation

### World Bank REST API

The platform fetches live South African education statistics from the World Bank Open Data API.

**Endpoint used:**

```
GET https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/ZA/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR?format=json&mrv=5
```

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `country` | `ZA` | South Africa (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) |
| `indicator` | `SE.SEC.ENRR` | Secondary school gross enrollment rate (%) |
| `format` | `json` | Response format |
| `mrv` | `5` | Most recent 5 data points |

**Response shape:**

```json
[
  { "page": 1, "pages": 1, "total": 5 },
  [
    { "date": "2023", "value": 93.12, ... },
    { "date": "2022", "value": 92.45, ... }
  ]
]
```

The app extracts `json[1]`, filters out null values, rounds percentages, and displays year-over-year trends on the landing page and dashboard. If the API is unreachable, static fallback data is used.
